Automated copy trading bot for Hyperliquid DEX. Copies trades from any wallet in real-time with automatic position sizing.

## Features

- Real-time trade copying via WebSocket
- Automatic position sizing based on account balance ratio
- Integer leverage with asset-specific limits
- Market and limit order support
- Copy existing positions on startup
- Simulated trading mode for testing
- Telegram notifications (optional)

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Installation

1. Install Python 3.12+
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure .env file with your settings
4. Run the bot:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Configuration

Edit the `.env` file:

```properties
# Hyperliquid API
HYPERLIQUID_API_URL=https://api.hyperliquid.xyz

# Your Hyperliquid credentials (leave empty for simulation)
HYPERLIQUID_WALLET_ADDRESS=
HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY=

# Target to copy (wallet or vault)
TARGET_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...

# Trading mode
SIMULATED_TRADING=true
SIMULATED_ACCOUNT_BALANCE=10000.0

# Copy settings
COPY_OPEN_POSITIONS=true
COPY_EXISTING_ORDERS=true
AUTO_ADJUST_SIZE=true
USE_LIMIT_ORDERS=false
MAX_SLIPPAGE_PCT=1.0
LEVERAGE_ADJUSTMENT=1.0
MAX_OPEN_TRADES=x
MAX_OPEN_ORDERS=x
MAX_ACCOUNT_EQUITY=x

# Asset Filters
BLOCKED_ASSETS=BTC,ETH  # Comma-separated list (e.g., BTC,ETH,SOL)

# Telegram (optional)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=

# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/trading.db

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FILE=./logs/trading.log
```

Notes:
- `TARGET_WALLET_ADDRESS` accepts either a wallet address or a vault address.
- `x` means unlimited; set an integer to cap `MAX_OPEN_TRADES`, `MAX_OPEN_ORDERS`, or `MAX_ACCOUNT_EQUITY`.
- Hyperliquid enforces a $10 minimum notional per order. If your account is much smaller than the target, small fills will be skipped when the proportional size falls below $10. Increase balance or reduce the ratio gap to copy more trades.
- Set `SIMULATED_TRADING=false` to enable live orders. In live mode the bot reads the configured wallet's real balance; `SIMULATED_ACCOUNT_BALANCE` is ignored.
- Live market orders are IOC orders priced from the current mid with `MAX_SLIPPAGE_PCT` tolerance. Start with a small amount and verify the logs before increasing exposure.

## Leverage Adjustment

The `LEVERAGE_ADJUSTMENT` setting controls risk:

- 0.5 = Use 50% of target's leverage (safer)
- 1.0 = Match target's leverage exactly
- 2.0 = Use 200% of target's leverage (more aggressive)

Leverage is automatically rounded to integers and capped at asset-specific maximums.

## Blocked Assets

The `BLOCKED_ASSETS` setting lets you exclude specific assets from copying:

```properties
BLOCKED_ASSETS=BTC,ETH,SOL
```

When the target wallet trades these assets, the bot will:

- Log a warning message
- Skip copying the trade
- Continue monitoring other assets normally

This is useful for:

- Avoiding high-volatility assets
- Excluding assets you're manually trading
- Managing risk by limiting exposure to certain markets

Note: Asset symbols are case-insensitive (BTC, btc, Btc all work).

## Position Sizing

Position sizes are automatically calculated based on the ratio of your account balance to the target wallet balance.

Example:

- Target wallet: $100,000
- Your account: $10,000
- Ratio: 1:10
- Target opens 1 BTC position = You open 0.1 BTC position

## Docker Commands

### Windows

Use the batch files in the `windows/` folder:

```cmd

logs.bat     # View logs
stop.bat     # Stop the bot
```

### Linux/Mac

Use the shell scripts in the `linux/` folder:

```bash
cd linux
chmod +x *.sh       # Make executable (first time only)
./start.sh          # Start the bot
./logs.sh           # View logs
./stop.sh           # Stop the bot
```
